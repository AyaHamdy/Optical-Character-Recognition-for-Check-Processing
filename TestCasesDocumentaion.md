## Test Case Documentation

### Test Case: test_no_file_part

**Description:**
This test case verifies the behavior of the OCR API when no file part is included in the POST request.

**Test Steps:**
1. Send a POST request to the `/ocr` endpoint without including any file part.
2. Check the response status code.
3. Check if the response contains the expected error message indicating the absence of the 'file' part.

### Test Case: test_valid_file_upload

**Description:**
This test case verifies the behavior of the OCR API when a valid image file is uploaded.

**Test Steps:**
1. Mock the OCR engine to return a predefined OCR result.
2. Create a dummy image file and include it in a multipart/form-data POST request.
3. Send the request to the `/ocr` endpoint.
4. Check the response status code.
5. Check if the response contains the expected OCR result.

**Expected Result:**
- The response should have a status code of 200, indicating success.

2. Open a local image file and include it in a multipart/form-data POST request.
3. Send the request to the `/ocr` endpoint.
4. Check the response status code.
5. Check if the response contains the expected OCR result.
